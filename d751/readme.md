# Problem

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has O(h) space complexity, where h is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using O(1) space.

# Solution

I'm not 100% confident on this one. I think that a simple int array counts as O(1) but I admint my academic CS is a bit behind me. Regardless it was fun to do an inorder traversal on a B-Tree as I haven't done any BTree work in quite a while.
